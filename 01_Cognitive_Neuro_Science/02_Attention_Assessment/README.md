# Attention and Focus Assessment Platform

## Overview

A comprehensive cognitive assessment platform designed to evaluate different types of attention (selective, divided, sustained) and track cognitive performance over time. This system provides interactive tests based on established neuropsychological paradigms and generates detailed analytics for clinical, educational, and research applications.

## Features

### ðŸ§  Cognitive Tests
- **Selective Attention**: Flanker Task, Visual Search, Stroop Test
- **Divided Attention**: Dual N-Back, Multi-Modal Tasks
- **Sustained Attention**: Continuous Performance Test (CPT), Vigilance Tasks
- **Working Memory**: Digit Span, Spatial Span Tests

### ðŸ“Š Analytics & Reporting
- Real-time performance metrics
- Progress tracking over time
- Detailed statistical analysis
- Comparative normative data
- Export capabilities (CSV, PDF reports)

### ðŸŽ¯ Applications
- ADHD screening and monitoring
- Cognitive rehabilitation
- Educational assessment
- Research in attention disorders
- Performance optimization training

## Technical Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pygame** - Interactive test interface
- **OpenCV** - Computer vision for eye tracking (optional)
- **Pandas** - Data analysis and management
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** - Statistical analysis
- **Tkinter** - GUI components

## Installation

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pygame opencv-python pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn pillow
```

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/attention-assessment-platform.git
cd attention-assessment-platform
```

### Setup
```bash
python setup.py
```

## Quick Start

```python
from attention_platform import AttentionAssessment

# Initialize assessment
assessment = AttentionAssessment()

# Run selective attention test
results = assessment.run_flanker_task(duration=300)  # 5 minutes

# View results
assessment.generate_report(results)
```

## Test Descriptions

### 1. Flanker Task (Selective Attention)
Measures ability to suppress irrelevant information. Participants respond to a central arrow while ignoring flanking arrows that may point in the same (congruent) or opposite (incongruent) direction.

### 2. Continuous Performance Test (Sustained Attention)
Evaluates sustained attention over extended periods. Participants monitor a stream of stimuli and respond to specific target sequences.

### 3. Dual N-Back (Divided Attention)
Assesses working memory and divided attention by requiring participants to monitor multiple stimulus streams simultaneously.

### 4. Visual Search Task
Measures selective attention efficiency by having participants locate target items among distractors in visual arrays.
