# EEG-Based Emotion Recognition System

A comprehensive machine learning system for detecting and classifying human emotions from EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals. This project demonstrates the application of signal processing and machine learning techniques in computational neuroscience and brain-computer interface development.

## üß† Project Overview

This system analyzes brainwave patterns recorded through EEG to identify four primary emotional states:
- **Joy/Happiness** - Associated with increased beta and gamma wave activity
- **Sadness** - Characterized by higher delta and theta wave patterns  
- **Stress/Anxiety** - Shows elevated and irregular beta wave activity
- **Relaxation/Calm** - Dominated by alpha wave oscillations (8-13 Hz)

## üî¨ Scientific Background

The system is based on well-established neuroscientific research showing that different emotional states correspond to distinct patterns of neural oscillations:

- **Delta waves (0.5-4 Hz)**: Deep sleep, unconscious processes
- **Theta waves (4-8 Hz)**: Meditation, creativity, emotional processing
- **Alpha waves (8-13 Hz)**: Relaxed awareness, calm focus
- **Beta waves (13-30 Hz)**: Active thinking, concentration, anxiety
- **Gamma waves (30-100 Hz)**: Higher cognitive functions, consciousness

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Multi-domain Feature Extraction**: Combines time-domain and frequency-domain features
- **Advanced Signal Processing**: Uses Welch's method for power spectral density analysis
- **Multiple ML Models**: Supports Random Forest and SVM classifiers
- **Cross-validation**: Implements k-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation
- **Real-time Prediction**: Capable of classifying emotions from new EEG data
- **Comprehensive Visualization**: Generates confusion matrices, PCA plots, and feature importance charts
- **Model Persistence**: Save and load trained models for future use

## üìä Technical Implementation

### Feature Engineering
The system extracts 17 features per EEG channel:

**Time Domain Features (7):**
- Mean, Standard Deviation, Variance
- Skewness, Kurtosis (distribution shape)
- Maximum, Minimum values

**Frequency Domain Features (10):**
- Absolute power in 5 frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma)
- Relative power ratios for each frequency band

### Machine Learning Pipeline
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Standardization using Z-score normalization
2. **Feature Selection**: Automatic feature importance ranking
3. **Model Training**: Random Forest (default) or SVM with RBF kernel
4. **Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score metrics
5. **Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation for generalization assessment
